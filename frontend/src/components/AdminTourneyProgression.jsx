//This component will display all match couples and their respective round reported scores, the admin will have the ability to 
//manually overide any score submitted, we will use some form of CSS to assist the admin in deciding if scores are submitted properly


//I plan on first implementing a manual progression system for admins since this general system will remain useful beyond the implementation of auto-completed rounds

//Reasons for manual progression: 
//1) if a player does not respond or report, this will allow the admin to intervene and progress the tournament
//2) if a player mistakenly or willingly reports an incorrect score which would directly affect the state of the tournament, allows the admin a layer of intervention
