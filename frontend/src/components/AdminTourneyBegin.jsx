/* This will house the logic for the Admin force tourney creation

 -The button will only appear if the tourney is yet to begin
 -startParticipantCount will always be less then total participant count in these cases, we will need to fill a participants array with nulls 
 -We will need to use helper functions such as balanceByes to balance our nulls
 -We will create the json manager object
 -We will store the tournamentID, manager object, id|participant mapping, etc for later use
 -Tournament will render, button will fade
 -Update DB field began = 1
